# TwoSample-Test-Cov

The folder contains the codes in the paper “**Testing and signal identification for two-sample high-dimensional covariances via multi-level thresholding**” (2023), *Journal of Econometrics* 
(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2022.10.008).  

The directories and files are summarized as follows: 
- "codes_part" folder: functions used in the main code, the information and explanations are included at the top of each function  
- "Size_evaluation_Gaussian_Main.R": main code used to obtain the empirical sizes for the proposed multi-level thresholding test  
- "Power_evaluation_Gaussian_Main.R": main code used to obtain the empirical powers for the proposed multi-level thresholding test  
- "Multiple_testing_Main.R": main code used to carry out the proposed multiple testing procedure
